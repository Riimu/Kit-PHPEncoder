# PHP Variable Exporter #

*PHPEncoder* is a PHP library for exporting variables and generating PHP code
representations for said variables similar to the built in function
`var_export()`. Compared to the built in function, however, this library
provides more options to customize the output, which makes it easier to generate
code for different kinds of purposes such as readable configuration files or
optimized cache files.

The purpose of this library is to address some of the shortcomings with the
built in `var_export()`. For example, there is no way to control the amount of
whitespace in the output and there is no way to choose between different array
notations. This library also provides functionality to convert objects into PHP
code that is actually useful when compared to the built in function.

The large number of customization options in this library allows you to create
code that fits your purposes. You can create very compact code, when you need to
limit the size of the output, or you can create code in the style that actually
fits in any of your dynamically generated PHP files.

## Requirements ##

In order to use this library, the following requirements must be met:

  * PHP version 5.4

## Installation ##

This library can be installed by using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). In
order to do this, you must download the latest Composer version and run the
`require` command to add this library as a dependency to your project. The
easiest way to complete these two tasks is to run the following two commands
in your terminal:

```
php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php
php composer.phar require "riimu/kit-phpencoder:2.*"
```

If you already have Composer installed on your system and you know how to use
it, you can also install this library by adding it as a dependency to your
`composer.json` file and running the `composer install` command. Here is an
example of what your `composer.json` file could look like:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "riimu/kit-phpencoder": "2.*"
    }
}
```

After installing this library via Composer, you can load the library by
including the `vendor/autoload.php` file that was generated by Composer during
the installation.

### Manual installation ###

You can also install this library manually without using Composer. In order to
do this, you must download the [latest release](https://github.com/Riimu/Kit-PHPEncoder/releases/latest)
and extract the `src` folder from the archive to your project folder. To load
the library, you can simply include the `src/autoload.php` file that was
provided in the archive.

## Usage ##

The most relevant method provided by this library is the `encode()` method
provided by `PHPEncoder`. The method takes any value as an argument and returns
the PHP code representation for that value.

For example:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$encoder = new \Riimu\Kit\PHPEncoder\PHPEncoder();
echo $encoder->encode(['foo' => 'bar', [1, true, false, null, 1.0]]);
```

This would create the following output:

```
[
    'foo' => 'bar',
    [1, true, false, null, 1.0],
]
```

Of course, the most important feature of this library is the ability to
customize the created the PHP code. As the second argument, the `encode()`
method takes an array of options, which can be used to customize the returned
PHP code. For example:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$encoder = new \Riimu\Kit\PHPEncoder\PHPEncoder();
echo $encoder->encode(['foo' => 'bar', [1, true, false, null, 1.0]], [
    'array.inline' => false,
    'array.omit' => false,
    'array.indent' => 2,
    'boolean.capitalize' => true,
    'null.capitalize' => true,
]);
```

This would create the following output:

```
[
  'foo' => 'bar',
  0 => [
    0 => 1,
    1 => TRUE,
    2 => FALSE,
    3 => NULL,
    4 => 1.0,
  ],
]
```

### Options ###

Encoding options allow you to customize the output of the `encode()` method. It
is possible to set these options in three different ways:

  * Options can be provided as an array to the `PHPEncoder` constructor.
  * Option values can be set via the `setOption()` method.
  * Options can be passed as an array as the second argument to the `encode()`
    method.

Note that options passed to the `encode()` method are only temporary and do not
apply to following calls.

#### List of Options ####

  * **whitespace** : &lt;boolean&gt; (true)<br>
    When set to `false`, generation of all extra whitespace is disabled and all
    other settings that affect whitespace are ignored.

  * **null.capitalize** : &lt;boolean&gt; (false)<br>
    When set to `true`, all `null` values are written in upper case instead of
    lower case.

  * **boolean.capitalize** : &lt;boolean&gt; (false)<br>
    When set to `true`, all `true` and `false` values are written in upper case
    instead of lower case.

  * **float.integers** : &lt;boolean|"all"&gt; (false)<br>
    When set to `true`, any float that represents an integer and has a value
    that is accurately represented by the floating point number will be encoded
    as an integer instead of a float. (e.g. the value `2.0` will be encoded as
    `2`). To include the values that are not accurately represented, you may set
    option to `"all"`.

  * **float.precision** : &lt;integer|false&gt; (17)<br>
    The maximum precision of encoded floating point values, which usually also
    means the maximum number of digits in encoded floats. If the value is set to
    `false`, the PHP ini setting `serialize_precision` will be used instead.
    Note that due to the way floating point values work, a value greater than 17
    does not provide any additional precision.

  * **string.escape** : &lt;boolean&gt; (true)<br>
    When set to `true`, all strings containing bytes outside the 32-126 ASCII
    range will be written with double quotes and the characters outside the
    range will be escaped.

  * **array.short** : &lt;boolean&gt; (true)<br>
    When set to `true`, arrays are enclosed using square brackets `[]` instead
    using of the long array notation `array()`.

  * **array.base** : &lt;integer|string&gt; (0)<br>
    Base indentation for arrays as a number of spaces or as a string. Provides
    convenience when you need to output code to a file with specific level of
    indentation.

  * **array.indent** : &lt;integer|string&gt; (4)<br>
    Amount of indentation for single level of indentation as a number of spaces
    or a string.

  * **array.align** : &lt;boolean&gt; (false)<br>
    When set to `true`, array assignment operators `=>` are aligned to the same
    column using spaces. Even if enabled, `array.omit` and `array.inline`
    options are still respected, but only if all the keys in the specific array
    can be omitted.

  * **array.inline** : &lt;boolean|integer&gt; (70)<br>
    When set to `true`, any array that can be written without any array keys
    will be written in a single line. If an integer is provided instead, the
    array will be written as a single line only if it does not exceed that
    number of characters. This option has no effect when `array.omit` is set to
    false.

  * **array.omit** : &lt;boolean&gt; (true)<br>
    When set to `true`, any redundant array keys will not be included (e.g. the
    array `[0 => 'a', 1 => 'b']` would be encoded just as `['a', 'b']`).

  * **array.eol** : &lt;string|false&gt; (false)<br>
    The end of line character used by array output. When set to `false`, the
    default `PHP_EOL` will be used instead.

  * **object.method** : &lt;boolean&gt; (true)<br>
    When set to `true`, any encoded object will be checked for methods `toPHP()`
    and `toPHPValue()`. If the method `toPHP()` exists, the returned string will
    be used as the PHP code representation of the object. If the method
    `toPHPValue()` exists instead, the returned value will be encoded as PHP and
    used as the code representation of the object.

  * **object.format** : &lt;string&gt; ('vars')<br>
    Default object encoding format. The possible values are:

     * `string` casts the object to string and then encodes that string as PHP.
     * `serialize` serializes the object and wraps it with `unserialize()`
     * `export` mimics the `var_export()` object representation
     * `array` casts the object to an array and encodes that array
     * `vars` turns object into an array using `get_object_vars()`
     * `iterate` turns the object into an array by iterating over it with `foreach`

  * **object.cast** : &lt;boolean&gt; (true)<br>
    Whether to add an `(object)` cast in front of arrays generated from objects
    or not when using the object encoding formats `vars`, `array` or `iterate`.

  * **recursion.detect** : &lt;boolean&gt; (true)<br>
    When set to `true`, the encoder will attempt to detect circular references
    in arrays and objects to avoid infinite loops.

  * **recursion.ignore** : &lt;boolean&gt; (false)<br>
    When set to `true`, any circular reference will be replaced with `null`
    instead of throwing an exception.

  * **recursion.max** : &lt;integer|false&gt; (false)<br>
    Maximum number of levels when encoding arrays and objects. Exception is
    thrown when the maximum is exceeded. Set to `false` to have no limit.

## Known Issues ##

### Recursive arrays on PHP < 5.4.5 ###

If you try to encode recursive arrays on PHP versions earlier than 5.4.5, you
may encounter the following error (due to the way array comparisons work
internally in PHP):

`Fatal error:  Nesting level too deep - recursive dependency?`

In order to fix this, you should disable the recursive array detection by
setting the option `recursion.detect` to false and set a value for the option
`recursion.max` to prevent recursive arrays from causing an infinite loop.

### Float precision on HHVM ###

Note that HHVM does not support the ini setting `serialize_precision`. Thus,
the use of the value `false` for the option `float.precision` is not supported
on HHVM.
